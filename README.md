# Setting up the Parser

## Introduction

The parser is a tool that can be used to extract data from a specific file format. In this guide, we will walk through the steps to set up the parser on your local machine. Fortunately, there are no special requirements needed to get it working.

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the repository on GitHub.
2.  Click on the green "Code" button.
3.  Choose the option to clone the repository using either the command line or GitHub Desktop.
4.  Follow the prompts to complete the cloning process.

## Running the Parser

Once you have cloned the repository, you can start using the parser right away. Here are the steps to get started:

1.  Open the parser in your preferred code editor, such as Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ.
2.  Locate the file that you want to parse.
3.  Open the parser file in the editor.
4.  Run the parser on the file by clicking the "Run" button or by using the command line.

The parser should start processing the file and extracting the data. Once the parsing is complete, you can use the extracted data for further analysis or processing.

## Conclusion

By cloning the parser repository and running it on your local machine, you can easily extract data from files in a specific format. Be sure to check the parser's documentation for any additional instructions or configuration options.
